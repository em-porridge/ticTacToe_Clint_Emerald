Usage: python client.py <host> <port>

<host> is the IP address of the server
<port> is the port number for the server

For convenience, <host> and <port> may be hard-coded into the script to prevent the need to use command line arguments:
- add the IP to the hosts dictionary
- specify which host to use in HOST
- specify which port to use in PORT
- provide a True to the call to get_connection_args

Known strange behaviour:
- the game board sometimes does not output on the command line (Ubuntu Linux 20.04).
- the game board consistently outputs as expected in the PyCharm IDE

N.B. This script requires python >= 3.8
