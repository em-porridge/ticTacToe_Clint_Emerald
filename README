usage: client.py [-h] [--version VERSION] [--port PORT] host

host is the IP address of the server
port is the port number for the server. Default is 65432
version is the protocol version to use. Default is 1 (but, for assignment 2, you want version 2)

Known strange behaviour:
- the game board sometimes does not output on the command line (Ubuntu Linux 20.04).
- the game board consistently outputs as expected in the PyCharm IDE

N.B. This script requires python >= 3.8
